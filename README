# Wt-RPM

## Compilation

### Dependencies

#### Ping support

If you are interested in supporting ping, you will have to install liboping.

#### Raspberry Pi backend

To compile the Raspberry Pi backend, please make sure you have installed libwiringPi.

### Compilation

To compile the project, please execute the following steps:

If you plan on using Wt's internal http server:

	CONNECTOR="-DUSE_CON_HTTP=ON"

otherwise

	CONNECTOR="-DUSE_CON_HTTP=OFF"

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr $CONNECTOR

Review the summary, fix as needed. Then do:

	make
	sudo make install

## Configuration

Wt_rpm's configuration must be stored in one of the following location:
  - ./wt-rpm.json
  - ../wt-rpm.json
  - ~/.wt-rpm.json
  - /etc/wt-rpm.json

The file must follow the JSON format and must contain the backend attribute.
At the moment, there are only two acceptable attribute: rasprpm and dummy_rpm.
Here is a sample configuration file:

{
        "backend": "rasprpm",
        "configuration": {
                "computers": [
                        {
                                "name": "pc1",
                                "ip_address": "192.168.0.42",
                                "read_acl": ["all"],
                                "write_acl": [],

                                "power_led_gpio": {
                                        "pin": 6,
                                        "inverted": "true"
                                },

                                "power_switch_gpio": {
                                        "pin": 8,
                                        "inverted": "false"
                                },

                                "atx_switch_gpio": {
                                        "pin": 10,
                                        "inverted": "false"
                                }
                        },

                        {
                                "name": "pc2",
                                "ip_address": "192.168.0.43",
                                "read_acl": ["toto", "john"],
                                "write_acl": ["toto"],

                                "power_led_gpio": {
                                        "pin": 1,
                                        "inverted": "true"
                                },

                                "power_switch_gpio": {
                                        "pin": 0,
                                        "inverted": "false"
                                },

                                "atx_switch_gpio": {
                                        "pin": 7,
                                        "inverted": "false"
                                }
                        }
                ]
        }
}

## Post-Install
After installing Wt-RPM, the program needs some special capabilities to run as a normal user. Please run the following:

setcap "CAP_NET_RAW=+ep CAP_SYS_RAWIO=+ep" /usr/bin/wt_rpm

Please also make sure that the user has the right to write to /dev/mem.

### Systemd

If you are able to execute wt_rpm properly, you can use the shipped systemd unit (configured for the user wtrpm).
