# How to use systemd to launch wt_rpm

## /var/run/wt

To make sure /run/wt is created at boot (/run and /var/run on tmpfs),
simply put the wtcomments.conf file in /etc/tmpfiles.d/

## systemd service unit

There are several systemd units that you can use according to how you compiled wt:

* wtrpm.service: For wt applications compiled with the built-in http server

In order to use systemd to launch wtrpm, copy the wanted service file
to /etc/systemd/system/.

Then reload systemd unit files with:
# systemctl --system daemon-reload

To start it, use:
# systemctl start <wanted service>.service

And to enable it for startup at boot:
# systemctl enable <wanted service>.service
